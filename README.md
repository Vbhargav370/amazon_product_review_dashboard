Amazon | Product Review Dashboard | Using power BI

Hello everyone! 👋
This is Bhargav, and I am currently pursuing my MCA at Aditya College of Engineering & Technology.

In this video, I am excited to showcase my skills in Power BI by creating a Product Review Dashboard using a dataset focused on sales, discounts, and customer ratings.

Using this dataset, I analyzed key metrics such as:
✅ Total sales, discounts, and ratings across product categories
✅ Discount percentage and revenue distribution by category
✅ Location-based trends in sales and customer satisfaction

This dashboard helps businesses track their performance by identifying:
📊 Top-performing categories and locations
📊 Discount trends and their impact on sales
📊 Insights into customer preferences based on reviews and ratings

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to:
✔️ Transform and clean data for analysis
✔️ Visualize complex datasets in an interactive and user-friendly format
✔️ Generate actionable insights for decision-making using Power BI tools

I am thrilled to share my learning experience and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions to improve further! 🚀
